      # Project background


      Realti360 is a modular simulation ecosystem incorporating a patient
      simulator, CPR feedback and video in a single system.


      We were asked to help extend the app to desktop and mobile devices to
      cater for new and growing features, environments and customer needs.


      ## Re-architected control layout


      The changes to the header bring a clearer hierarchy to the elements
      within, resulting in more room to add critical controls.

      Resulted structure allows the UI to be adapted to different screen sizes.


      ## Layout / Widgets


      A redesigned widget ecosystem and layout manager allows clinicians and
      teachers to customize their layouts for their own use case.

      This makes the ecosystem of shared devices in hospitals and training
      centres.&#x20;

      ## Rethinking the layout.&#x20;


      We rethought how a single-screen device could work across different
      devices, from mobile to big screen monitors.&#x20;


      We adopted The Grid - an extensible, module approach for each
      control.&#x20;

      We had to incorporate into our thinking that the learning environment for
      clinicians is one where they have a small window of time to teach,
      in-between patients and rounds.

      ## Customised layouts make context switching a breeze.


      Workspaces make creating a custom set of controls much easier to manage
      across several teachers, all from the one device. Users can choose
      pre-defined layouts.&#x20;
