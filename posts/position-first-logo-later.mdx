When you’re at the formation stage of your product, it’s really common to focus on the things that seem important. Business name, logo, slogan, corporate structure, tech stack - all the elements that other, much bigger, much more serious business have. And, after all, you’re a serious business, right?

So that means you need a brand. You need modern, beautiful authentically divine logos and fonts and colours and something called a ‘mission statement’. And a website! AND BUSINESS CARDS! WHAT ABOUT T-SHIRTS!? AND AND AND..
Slow down. First thing is first. 

Before you can declare to people who you are, you need to figure out why you are. You need to work out your position.

# What is positioning
Positioning [link] is how you want customers to think about your product or service.
You see the Nike swoosh you think athletic shoes, you see Volvo, you think car safety, you see Apple you think ‘Simplicity’.
Positioning is hard because it requires you to close doors to potential. Positioning is about focus. It’s planting a flag and saying, ‘This is who we are.’

You can’t be all things to all people, and it goes doubly for business. The more focused, the more niche, the better chance that you matter to your customers.

# WTF is a brand strategy
A brand strategy is how you position yourself to create demand for your service in a particular market. Simply put, it’s how you foster how people perceive you. If you’re Nike, your brand strategy is to associate yourself with high-performing athletes. Apple, you make
Technology startups and positioning.

One big advantage of being the first to market is that you’re able to occupy the position in people’s heads. Xerox did this in the 60s and 70s, whereby they were so successful that associating ‘making paper copies’ was ‘xeroxing’ something. We now ‘Google’. Some people order a Lyft yet say, “I’m gonna Uber in”.

Know this - once a company is positioned in the mind of the consumer, it’s really hard for another brand to overtake that space.
