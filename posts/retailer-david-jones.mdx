# Retailer David Jones could be more

A quick story. Buying a suit. I’m a fancy man. But I’m a man, so the shopping experience is largely a balance between not looking stupid and trying to look acceptable wearing uncomfortable clothing. On the scale of 1 to 10 on the fashion-scale, I’m a solid 5. I know what I like. I’m not ambivalent in what I wear, but I’m not adventurous or overly knowledgeable on the finer points. 

It’s Sunday. My wife and I drive in and park our car into David Jones. We take the elevator up to the men’s floor.  I head towards what looks like a safe area and get my bearings. I’m trying to avoid getting any sales persons eye because frankly I don’t want to go through a trial-and-error of them understanding my fashion wants. What they’d find out is that I’m up to wear generally anything as long as it’s: 

1. Comfortable  
2. Doesn’t make me look stupid. 
3. A distant third is looking good. At 37 years old, the ship has sailed on trying to look like James Bond. 

Also ego plays a role. I don’t want to look helpless.

I don’t know what my measurements. I don’t know the difference between a European fit and a Slim Regular fit. Can ****can**** I wear? 

If I’m going to start pulling random stuff off the rack to try I should know what’s going to fit. 

I ask the nice sales woman nearby to measure me. She is baffled by this request. “that’s not how it works” she says. The look on her face is mild annoyance. I’m entering ‘looking stupid’ territory. I look to my wife, she’s unsure of my request too. I explain I’m trying to remember my sizes and if she has a tape measure, could I get her to measure me up? She explains she only works for the one brand and they don’t require measurements. But bless her she puts a measuring tape limply around my neck. She’s confused. I’m confused. My wife is confused. “You’re a 40 neck but it doesn’t matter” the saleswoman says.  I’m drowning, and she’s shoving a hose in my mouth. 

I flee, and head to the an area adorned with tuxes and suits. This hasn’t been a good start. I head towards the suits and start lightly touching a few things. I think I know how a tuxedo works, the tails and such. I’ve seen James Bond. But I don’t know for sure and I’m rattled by the saleswoman. 

There’s a young guy dressed impeccably that appears and asks if he can help gesturing towards the tuxedo I’m molesting. 

I explain I have a wedding and it requires a tuxedo. There’s also a few events lately where I’ve needed to be more formal. “I’m a fancy man”, I explain. He nods. He pulls out a tape-measure to get my measurements. I orgasm immediately.

The sales guy name is Henry. Henry is all business. There’s no judgement, just cold efficiency. I’m the lost sheep, Henry is my Shepard. 

**Some other moments** 

- Now knowing my measurements I head back to the area where the baffled lady was monitoring. I choose a shirt right under her nose. It’s petty of me. The scene from Pretty Woman plays in my head for some reason.
- In my hand is a shirt I’ve picked up for business shirt reasons. High-powered business situations, hanging out with world leaders, accepting awards etc.  Henry sees what’s in my hand,  and says ‘try this too’. Henry is right.  It’s a better fit. It’s more comfortable. Henry is *********crushing********* it.
- In retail-terms, I’m getting up-sold across the park. Pocket-squares get chucked into the mix.   I don’t care. This isn’t something I do every day, so I throw caution to the wind.

At the counter, I’m asked if I have a membership card. I don’t, but my wife pipes up and says to put it under her mother’s account. Henry does this.  I’m asked if I’d like my measurements stored and then emailed to me for future use. I respond with an aggressive yes. 

I leave the store happy. Sadly, Henry’s email never arrived.

The above story - my luke-warm buying journey - is just a single data point. [But I’m not alone.](https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/retail/not-what-youd-expect-epic-fail-in-david-jones-store/news-story/f62680afc98529b5f98acc368d3108ff)

There’s a number of opportunities that have gone begging in-store -  but the big one happens after I leave the store - that is it to say - nothing happens.

**Make it about meeeee** 

The greatest opportunity concession retailers have is bridging the gap between knowing who I am with products I want. In a word: personalisation. There’s an opportunity here to revisit how a mobile app could serve as a cureated, personalised experience - serving recommendations and better discovery options. Chuck in AI and create a personality around it*.  Delivery at the press of a button, tighter integration between in-store and online.  The David-Jones style-assistant in your pocket - complementary, trusted, and valuable. You don't need to rely on clunky AR to try and guess my weight or size because that data should already be parsed from my most recent fitting room experience. However, using colour-theory for better choices, themes, occassions, fashion guideance and general suggestions on feeling more comfortable in wearing different clothes are all viable and achievable options. Hell, expand on the circular-highend fashion thing they've got going. They have the content, the experience, the data and the ecosystem. They just need the vision and interface.

**Could be an absolute shite idea.*

**Opportunity** 

Retail is getting a small bump in the post-COVID world as people remember what it’s like to touch something not made from Gorilla Glass. But the post-covid honeymoon is coming to an end and when the retailers wake up, they’re going to find that just existing isn’t enough. You have to do more for the customer. You have to start by making it about *them.*
